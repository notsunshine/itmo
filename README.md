# ITMO
[//]: # "⚠️ ***submodules* for new repos temporarily unavailable***"

This repository is the hub for the other ITMO lab repositories. You can  navigate to them by hyperlinks in the readme or by **submodules*** in the directories of this repository.  
This structure prevents github from being clogged with a bunch of small unimportant repositories (as if they were all on github.com/svinoczar), and also allows any user to clone any of these smaller repositories to their computer without any problems (as opposed to if they were all in one repository, like itmo-university or itmo-labs, and the user had to clone a relatively large repository just for one directory).
