# ITMO
This repository is the hub for the other ITMO lab repositories. You can  navigate to them by hyperlinks in the readme or by submodules in the directories of this repository.  
This structure prevents github from being clogged with a bunch of small unimportant repositories (as if they were all on github.com/notsunshine), and also allows any user to clone any of these smaller repositories to their computer without any problems (as opposed to if they were all in one repository, like itmo-university or itmo-labs, and the user had to clone a relatively large repository just for one directory).
